# Run a command in the virtual environment in which lorax was installed,
# whether that virtual environment was created by conda or by the
# virtualenv package.
#
# If the virtual environment is already activated, the only side-effect of
# this script is to set some environmental variables.  If the virtual
# environment is not activated, it will be activated before running the
# command (and deactivated at the end of this script).
#
# Usage:
#        run_in_lorax_env [-v] COMMAND
#
# Environmental variables:
#       FLASK_APP   Will be set to "lorax"
#       LORAX_ROOT  Will be set to the parent of this directory this file
#                   resides in.
#                         
# Useful in running supervisord, supervisorctl, and other lorax commands.
