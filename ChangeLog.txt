v0.92

get_config and set_config commands are now condensed to config_value
which does set if VALUE is defined, set get if now.  If VAR is not
defined, config_value lists all variables along with whether they were
set from environmental variables or not.

Broke up PATH from a dictionary to be three simple key:value objects:
   * DATA_PATH
   * LOG_PATH
   * DIR_MODE

v0.91

Package data moved to proper level of hierarchy.

ALIGNMENT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT and TREE_QUEUE_TIMEOUT config parameters.  Was defaulting to
180 seconds.

v0.9
Logging format is now configurable

Added commands for easier setup:
   * copy_test_files
   * get_config
   * set_config
   * test_logging

Added PhyD3 files to static and template folders.

Added GET method for /alignment target to return MSA's.

Created requirements.in and requirements.txt dependencies list via pip-sync.

Removed ete3 in favor of biopython due to ete3 dependency problems with BSD.
Less control over Newick formatting, though...trees may not appear to be rooted
in some downstream programs.


v0.8

Changed the tree output to be rooted, entailing a change in the exact Newick format used.
Root node names are family names.  Trees are now ladderized.  ete3 is now a dependency.

Added the /rq dashboard target. rq_dashboard is now a dependency.

Added commands.

Changed startup methods considerably.  See the startup scripts for details.

v0.7

Names of executables are now configuration parameters.  This allows for overriding of executable
names on platforms where the name may vary.

Added DELETE target for superfamiles.

Calculation methods now return JSON dictionaries of job listings that include the following:
    id: id string
    description: description string, e.g., "FastTree tree of superfamily aspartic_peptidases.myseqs"
    status: job.status, e.g., "deferred"
    tasktype: "align" or "tree"
    taskname: name of aligner or builder
    family: name of family
    superfamily: name of superfamily
    is_queued: True if queued.  This will not be true until after alignment in some cases.
    is_started: True if job is running.
    is_finished: True if job is finished (since queue was reset).
    is_failed: True if job failed due to an error.
    created_at: ISO format job creation time or "None".
    enqueued_at: ISO format time of queueing or "None".
    ended_at: ISO format ending time or "None".
    started_at: ISO format start time or "None".
    estimated_job_time: Estimated run time (wallclock) in seconds.
    queue_name: Name of queue (for future queries)
    queue_position: position in queue, if queued, or length of queue if not.
    estimated_queue_time: Estimated wallclock time of preceding jobs, in seconds.
For now all estimated times are bogus and simply placeholders until timing models are established.

Config parameters are settable via environmental variables starting with "LORAX_".

Configuration parameters are now settable by instance as a pyfile.

Improved logfile content.

Removed /config target as insecure.

Changed configuration from config.json to a Flask-standard pyfile.  See default_settings.py.

v0.6

Added /trees/<family>/hmmalign_FastTree target to chain calculations.

Added a polling method in test_all.sh to poll a URL until >= 0, useful for status polls.

Queueing for FastTree calculation via rq added.  Expects a queue named "FastTree".

v0.5

Added superfamily targets.

Added test_all.sh script to do full testing.

Changed "tree" target to tree.nwk.

Compute stats on HMM files and return as part of HMM addition.  If hmmstats fails,
abort with 417 and delete the HMM file.

Added /trees/families.json target.

Added /log.txt target that returns the current log file.

Added click as a dependency, removed flaskrun.py.

Moved config.py code to __init__.py.

Removed AutoIndex of / directory.

Changed HMM from POST to PUT for consistency with HTML specs.  Added put_HMM.sh script.
