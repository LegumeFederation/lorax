lorax is a Flask-based web service for calculating multiple sequence alignments
and phylogenetic trees for genes and gene families.  Under the hood, lorax uses
`FastTree`_ or `RAxML`_ to calculate trees, `HMMER`_ to do multiple sequence
alignments, `RQ`_ to queue long calculations, and `Flask`_ to serve up results.
