To upgrade from a previous version of lorax, start by activating
the virtual environment that you used.  For Anaconda Python, this
is done via "source activate ENV" where ENV is the name of the 
environment you created.  Then issue the following commands:

	lorax_env supervisorctl shutdown
    pip uninstall lorax
	pip install --no-cache-dir --global-option=build_py lorax
	lorax_env lorax configure_instance --force
    lorax_env supervisord; sleep 10
	lorax_env supervisorctl status

Then create a new test directory or go to the old one and issue the
following commands:

	lorax_env lorax create_test_files --force
	./test_all.sh

This command should finish with "lorax test completed successfully".
