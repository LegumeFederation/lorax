To upgrade from a previous version of lorax, start by activating
the virtual environment that you used.  For Anaconda Python, this
is done via "source activate ENV" where ENV is the name of the 
environment you created.  Then issue the following commands:

	run_in_lorax_env supervisorctl shutdown
	pip install -U lorax
	run_in_lorax_env configure_instance --force
        run_in_lorax_env supervisord; sleep 10
	run_in_lorax_env supervisorctl status

Then create a new test directory or go to the old one and issue the
following commands:

	run_in_lorax_env create_test_files --force
	source deactivate
	./test_all.sh

This command should finish with "lorax test completed successfully".
