lorax has been tested under macOS Sierra (10.12.5).  The minimum version for
proper function of Anaconda Python is MacOS 10.12.3.  

Installation of lorax currently requires use of git. To test if you have git 
installed, open a terminal window (under Applications -> Utilities) and issue
the command:
	
	git --version 

If this produces an error, the easiest way to install git is by installing the
XCode command-line tools, part of the XCode utilities, which are available for
free (but large) download from the App Store.

Once you have git installed, install Anaconda Python by visiting the URL
https://www.continuum.io/downloads.  You will want Python 3.6, for which the
current version is 4.4.0.  You must use a 64-bit version.  The command-line 
installer is fine, and 25% smaller.  When you have downloaded the installer,
issue the following command from a terminal window in the Downloads directory:

	bash Anaconda3-<version>-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

where <version> is the current version number.  As part of installation, please
ensure that the Anaconda Python bin/ directory is prepended to your path in 
~/.bash_profile or else you will have to prepend it manually before continuing
the installation and every time you wish to use lorax.

To continue the installation, follow the instructions in INSTALL.anaconda.txt.
We recommend installing lorax on the Mac via Anaconda Python because of the
complexities of building required binaries (biopython, FastTree, HMMer).
With Anaconda Biopython, most of the work is handled by the bioconda channel.
Building the requirements yourself is possible but unsupported.
