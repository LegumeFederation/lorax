lorax has been tested under macOS Sierra (10.12.6).

Installation of lorax currently requires use of git. To test if you have git 
installed, open a terminal window (under Applications -> Utilities) and issue
the command:
	
	git --version 

If this produces an error, the easiest way to install git is by installing the
XCode command-line tools, part of the XCode utilities, which are available for
free (but large) download from the App Store.

MacOS installs can either be via direct installation or via Anaconda Python's
package manager.  The latter is fast and easy, while the former takes more
time but gives more control and can be made to directly match the tested
configuration.


Direct Installation
-------------------
Besides the XCode tools, you will also need to install the PCRE and OpenSSL
libraries.  The tested configuration was with PCRE-8.40 and OpenSSL-1.10.f.
Both libraries were configured with CC=clang and installed to /usr/local.

To continue direct installation, follow the instructions in INSTALL.direct.txt.

Anaconda Python
---------------
The minimum OS version for proper function of Anaconda Python is MacOS 10.12.3.

If you don't have Anaconda Python installed, get it by visiting the URL
https://www.continuum.io/downloads.  You will want Python 3.6, for which the
current version is 4.4.0.  You must use a 64-bit version.  The command-line 
installer is fine, and 25% smaller.  When you have downloaded the installer,
issue the following command from a terminal window in the Downloads directory:

	bash Anaconda3-<version>-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

where <version> is the current version number.  As part of installation, please
ensure that the Anaconda Python bin/ directory is prepended to your path in 
~/.bash_profile or else you will have to prepend it manually before continuing
the installation and every time you wish to use lorax.

To continue the installation, follow the instructions in INSTALL.anaconda.txt.
