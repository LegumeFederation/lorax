lorax will run in python 3.4 and up.  Testing took place under python3.6.
We recommend that you start the installation by making sure your root
python installation is up-to-date before creating a virtual environment
(which may get updated by pip in a non-maintainable way).  Although it is
 possible to run lorax directly from the root installation,
it is not advisable to do so because lorax's dependencies could break other
python packages you may wish to install.

You will need a working "virtualenv" package for the python version you
wish to use.  I prefer to use the name "loraxenv" for the virtual
environment to prevent confusion between package and environment names.
You should create this environment as the user under which you intend the
web server to run, using the python version you wish to use selected
as default, with the following commands:

	virtualenv loraxenv
	cd loraxenv
	source bin/activate
	pip install -U setuptools # may produce an error, proceed anyway
	pip install numpy
	pip install biopython
	pip install --global-option=build_py lorax
	pip install git+git://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor.git@2c601db
	pip install superlance setuptools-scm

Next, we define a command of convenience for running a script that
defines two environmental variables and activates the correct virtual
environment from _outside_ the virtual environment:

    alias runinenv="${CONDA_PREFIX}/bin/run_in_lorax_env"
    deactivate

Next, follow the instructions in INSTALL.configure+run.txt.
