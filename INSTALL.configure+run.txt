We now configure lorax.  The first command will print a large number of
configuration variables.  If you wish to change any of them, do it before
issuing the "configure_instance" command, which will write the startup
configurations which include such things as port numbers and which processes
to start.  Configuration may be done either via the "lorax config" command
or via environmental variables.  In particular the "LORAX_MODE" environmental
variable controls the setting of multiple variables in defining which processes
will get started.  Usually you will want to configure the following variables
in order to expose the lorax server to the internet (substituting the
desired values in the places beginning with MY_):

	runinenv lorax config host MY_IP_ADDRESS
	runinenv lorax config crashmail_email MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS
	runinenv lorax create_instance


Now it is time to run lorax and associate processes:

	runinenv supervisord; sleep 10
	runinenv supervisorctl status

The first command daemonizes lorax and 4 associated commands.  The last
should return a list of 5 commands, all with status RUNNING.  When
you wish to shut down the lorax-related processes, you may issue the
command:

    runinenv supervisorctl shutdown

or simply issue "killall supervisord".

Next, follow the instructions for testing in INSTALL.test.txt.
