We now configure lorax.  The first command will print a large number of
configuration variables.  If you wish to change any of them, do it before
issuing the "configure_instance" command, which will write the startup
configurations which include such things as port numbers and which processes
to start.  Configuration may be done either via the "lorax config" command
or via environmental variables.  In particular the "LORAX_MODE" environmental
variable controls the setting of multiple variables in defining which processes
will get started.

	runinenv lorax config
	runinenv lorax configure_instance

Now it is time to run lorax and associate processes:

	runinenv supervisord; sleep 10
	runinenv supervisorctl status

The first command daemonizes lorax and 4 associated commands.  The last
should return a list of 5 commands, all with status RUNNING.  When
you wish to shut down the lorax-related processes, you may issue the
command:

    runinenv supervisorctl shutdown

or simply issue "killall supervisord".

Next, follow the instructions for testing in INSTALL.test.txt.
