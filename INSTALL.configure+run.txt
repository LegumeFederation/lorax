We now configure lorax.  To begin, we need to enter the proper
environment, using the lorax_env script.  The path to this script is
the value of LORAX_ROOT you chose at install time:

	/path/to/lorax_env -i

You will now get a "lorax_env> " prompt and you are ready to configure.

configuration variables.  If you wish to change any of them, do it before
issuing the "configure_instance" command, which will write the startup
configurations which include such things as port numbers and which processes
to start.  Configuration may be done either via the "lorax config" command
or via environmental variables.  In particular the "LORAX_MODE" environmental
variable controls the setting of multiple variables in defining which processes
will get started.  Usually you will want to configure the following variables
in order to expose the lorax server to the internet (substituting the
desired values in the places beginning with MY_):

	lorax config host MY_IP_ADDRESS
	lorax config crashmail_email MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS
	lorax create_instance


Now it is time to run lorax and associate processes:

	supervisord; sleep 10
	supervisorctl status

The first command daemonizes lorax and associated processes.  The last
should return a list of commands, all with status RUNNING. You may then
enter "control-D" to exit the lorax_env environment.

Next, follow the instructions for testing in INSTALL.test.txt.
