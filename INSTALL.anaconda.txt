lorax was tested under Anaconda Python 3.6. Begin by downloading it and
making sure that it is in your PATH.   

lorax requires some packages that are in non-default channels, which
may be obtained by the following:

	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	conda config --add channels defaults
	conda config --add channels bioconda

After the channels are configured, create a virtual environment for lorax
to use.  I prefer to use the name "loraxenv" for this environment to prevent
confusion between package and environment names.  You should create this
environment as the user you intend the web server to run as.

	export LORAX_CONDA_VENV=loraxenv
	conda create -y --name $LORAX_CONDA_VENV biopython click croniter \
           flask freetype gunicorn  msgpack-python raxml redis \
           redis-py itsdangerous jinja2 markupsafe six werkzeug
	source activate $LORAX_CONDA_VENV
	
If you are installing under MacOS (and only under MacOS), the following
is also needed:
	conda install gcc libgcc

Next one needs setuptools and gunicorn of later  version than that included
in anaconda and supervisord > 4.0 (which currently only exists in github:

	pip install https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/zipball/master
	pip install superlance
	pip install -U gunicorn
	pip install -U setuptools

The last command produces an error; don't be worried by it.  Now we are ready
 to install lorax itself:

	pip install --global-option=build_py lorax
	alias runinenv=${CONDA_PREFIX}/bin/run_in_lorax_env
	source deactivate

At this point, you are outside the virtual environment with an alias
to run_in_lorax_env inside the virtual environment.  That script, in
turn depends on a single environmental variable (LORAX_CONDA_VENV) to
function properly. We now configure lorax:

	# inspect config variables, all 76 of them
	runinenv lorax config 
	# example config if IP other than localhost is desired
	# runinenv lorax config host MYHOSTIP
	runinenv lorax create_instance

Now it is time to run lorax and associate processes:

	runinenv supervisord
	sleep 9
	runinenv supervisorctl status

The first command daemonizes lorax and 4 associated commands.  The last
should return a list of 5 commands, all with status RUNNING.  The easiest
way to kill the daemonized server processes is to kill the supervisord
process (with "killall" on linux).

Note that to start lorax from outside the virtual environment (e.g., from an rc
script) one can issue the commanda:
        export LORAX_CONDA_VENV="loraxenv"
	/path/to/loraxenv/bin/run_in_lorax_env supervisord

To test lorax, from inside the virtual environment issue the commands:
	mkdir loraxtest # could be any name, will be deleted later
        cd loraxtest
	runinenv lorax create_test_files
	chmod 755 *.sh
	source lorax_envvars.sh
	./test_all.sh

If the installation went properly, the last command should finish with
"lorax test completed successfully."
