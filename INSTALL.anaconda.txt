lorax was tested under Anaconda Python 3.6.  

lorax requires some packages that are in the bioconda channel, so before
installing lorax, the following channels must be added:

	conda config --add channels conda-forge
	conda config --add channels defaults
	conda config --add channels r
	conda config --add channels bioconda

After the channels are configured, the following dependencies should be
added.  I prefer adding them to the root installation, but you may prefer
to add them to the virtual environment to be constructed later:

	conda install biopython redis redis-py hmmer gcc libgcc raxml

Next, it is highly recommended that you create a virtual environment for
lorax to run in.  lorax depends on a version of setuptools that is
currently much higher than the version required by anaconda, so you may
break other packages if you install lorax in a shared environment:

	conda create --name loraxenv biopython click croniter flask \
	  gcc libgcc raxml redis redis-py itsdangerous jinja2 markupsafe \
	  python-dateutil rq six werkzeug

After installing these packages then, "pip install lorax" should get the
remaining packages directly from pypi.
