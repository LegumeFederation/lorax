To test lorax, issue the commands:

	mkdir test_lorax # could be any name, will be deleted later
    cd test_lorax
	runinenv lorax create_test_files
	./test_all.sh

If the installation went properly, the last command should finish with
"lorax test completed successfully."

You may also wish to load a full-sized data model to work with.  The
script "get_big_model.sh" will do that for you.  The model of 12
legume genomes (against the phytozome 10.2 HMM's) is rather big
at 900 MB of downloads and some 7 GB of data when loaded, so expect
this to take a while (about 30 minutes on a core i7 with SSD).
